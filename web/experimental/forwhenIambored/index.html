            <h2>It's normal to have times of boringness.</h2>
            <p>And in fact being bored stimulates the more relaxing parts of your brain, which often produces the most
                serene sensate outcomes.</p>
            <p>Like a well designed city. You can't be excited while drawing the straight lines that shape the roads.
                You gotta be tranquil.</p>
            <p>You sometimes have to stop and relax, breathe and think. Am I going through the right path? Is there somethings I must change in order to succeed?
            </p>
            <p>Clean up your mind of all the trash you've been absorbing while powerful. Organize and make hyerarchies, lists and schemes of your living plan.</p>
